I thought it was a human corpse 😭🙏
Oh my God 😭
"Already discarded, not buried but thrown away like trash 😭😭😭"
"I swear, pandawara, just stop it. If continued, residents will misuse it, even if not cleaned, they'll risk their own village's health."
"Let's consider pandawara as a baby, please take care of your typing."
"Guys, cleaning isn't just pandawara's task. It's easy to blame their performance, but luckily they're there. They're active youth teaching us about environmental care... Please stop nagging or blaming their performance."
You can easily throw away animals in the river...
"Already tired, the river got polluted again after just a month. The government seems to have no effort at all. At least give some education to the public."
Why did they comment like that?
"Believe me, the ones commenting to evoke emotions are just kids who don't know any better."
"Even a lizard's poop smells bad, what more human waste 😭🙏🏻"

"Guys, cleaning tasks aren't just Pandawara's job. It's easy to blame their performance, but luckily they're there. They're active youth teaching us to take care of the environment... Please stop nagging or blaming their performance."

"For those who comment ""iTuKaN tUgAs Lu"" (roughly ""This is your mess""), our environment is a shared responsibility, not just the janitors. If you only blame them, when will Indonesia ever become clean? (roughly)"
@ninikkurinci
"It's not hard to bury him, he could've been fertilizer too, poor thing being washed away like that 😭"
"Seems like he was digitally silenced before he died, his mouth was also sealed, so he might as well have been digitally silenced intentionally to shut him up 🙂"
It's tough to be thrown into the river like that 🥺
"Keep going, buddy!"

"Seems like his digituin (a slang term for a specific action) was already happening before he died, because his mouth was also sharp, so he might as well have done it intentionally to annoy people 🙂"
Ignore those comments that are too low 😹😹😹

Could you please respond regarding the refusal to clean the river in my area? There's already a lot of trash but no one wants to clean it up.
"Why are you all commenting on everything? It's not the trash that needs to be thrown out, it's the comment itself that should be removed."
"It could probably just be thrown into the river, there's no land around here anyway."
Shame on the environmental guard.
This is a comment about why it's become unreasonable.
Me.
"This comment from an Indonesian netizen is so ridiculous, it's like they're talking about dirt itself."

"Could be easily thrown into the river, not even worth the soil in that area."

This comment is already not balanced.
Me.
Is this netizen's comment as low as the dirt itself?
"The one who commented ""That's already the duty of river cleaners"" and ""In the city, I'm already dirty"" - please think with your brain, that's not their duty, we should be taught that everyone should participate in cleaning up the surroundings 😓."
"""Living in luxury"" is seen from how one speaks and is put into their bag."

"Why comment on everyone's trash, not the one that needs to be thrown out?"
"Maybe it can be thrown into the river, there's no land there anyway."
"Oh, environmental guard!"
This is a comment on why it's not balanced.
Me.
"Swear, isn't this netizen's comment as low as the ground?"
"The one who commented ""that's the Pandawara's job to clean the river"" and ""the city is already dirty here"" please think with your brain, it's not the Pandawara's duty, we're taught to clean up together, sadly..."
"""Living like kings"" is seen from the way they speak and put in their bags."
I'm also holding my breath. Despite the lack of stench here.
Maybe I should also cover my mouth. 😷🤣🤣
"Aren't you suspicious? That's the dog that's been beaten and thrown into a bag, then into the river. Because if it's being cared for, it would definitely be half-buried or thrown into the river."

I'll watch while struggling to breathe... jiiirr 😭😂
"Why weren't they buried, for real? 😭"
I'm the one who can't breathe 😭
"Poor thing, feels like crying 🥺"
There are so many low-quality comments.
So many stupid people commenting just for notifications.
"His spirit is really wandering, isn't it? (😄)"
😭😭😭
Just open the comments to know how low the SDM in Indonesia is.
"""Why didn't you call 911?"" 😂🙏"
Really taking advantage of the Indonesian people (+62).
I'm so craving for grilled cheese bananas right now... 😫 I'm speechless after watching this.
Is that blood vomit?
"Keep the spirit, bro!"
👍
Negative comments are really sick.
😭😭😭 @din
"You're the one who's going to bury me, the one who caught their breath 😷"
"I'm sure their death wasn't natural. If it was natural, they'd be cremated. But if they were just thrown away alive, it was intentional."
I watched it while holding my breath 😭😂
Why isn't this person buried yet 😭
I'm the one who can't breathe 😭
Poor thing 😥
There are so many low comments about it
So many stupid people commenting just for notifications

Keep the spirit up
Thumbs up 👍
The negative comment is truly hurting.
@din 😭😭😭
You're the one who's causing me to choke 😷
"I'm sure it's her angel who was killed, not died. Usually, if someone dies, they're burned. If not buried, it must have been intentional."
I'll watch it while choking back laughter jiiirr😭😂
"Why wasn't she buried, for real 😭"
I'm the one who can't breathe 😭

The negative comments are truly painful
@din 😭😭😭
You're the one who's going to bury me 😷

I'm the one who's going to hold my breath 😭

I'll watch it while holding my breath 😭😂
Why wasn't it buried? 😭
I couldn't hold my breath 😭
"It's pitiful, really 😢"
There are so many low comments...
So many stupid people commenting just for notifications...
"Its spirit was a wandering one, not a permanent one 😇"
I thought it was a baby bird
Why didn't the graveyard accept it?
It must be in a video because of validation issues 🤭
"The gym wants to move forward with Indonesian athletes, but the comments are so low... Be careful with your negative comments, you know who you are."
"Yet, it was a loyal, good animal... Even after death, it didn't get proper respect from human scum."

"Keep the spirit up, guys! 🇮🇩"
👍
That negative comment is really painful
@din 😭😭😭
You're the one who's making me laugh while holding my breath 😷

👍
The negative comments are truly sickening.
😭😭😭 @din
"You're the one who buries me, struggling to breathe 😷"

I think the baby is a mayt (a term used to describe something that's not quite right or suspicious).
Why isn't the grave of the zigzag (a term of endearment) being taken care of?
I'm sure it's in the video because of the validation issue.
"Let's move forward with Indo SD (a term for a specific level of education), just keep an eye on negative comments from trolls."

What is it?
Negative comments are really sick.
@din 😭😭😭
You're the one who's burying me while I'm struggling to breathe 😷

"Yet, it was a good, loyal animal. Why digitize it, even after death, the monkey doesn't get proper respect from human scum, padahal anj hewan yg baik yg setia tpi knp digituin bahkan stelah mati pun anj ga dpt penghormatan yg layak dasar manusia najis"

I'm feeling nauseous 😭
"You who order people to clean the trash in nearby rivers, if you don't have a 07AK, you don't know about M41U or D1R1, that's enough, right?"
"Come on, Javanese, the river next to my house isn't clean yet."
"Why is that, friend?"
"Wow, Jago's acting skills are really something 😹"
"That's why the dog's carcass is being tortured by people who don't like dogs, because if it dies, it should be buried out of love, what else can be done? 😭"

"Those who order the pandawara to clean the trash in the rivers near your home, if you don't have 07AK, you don't know about M41U or D1R1 😒 That's enough, just like that"
